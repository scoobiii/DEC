# Scenario: Pain, Litter, Challenge, Opportunity

1. **London was the financial capital of the world.** This was due to a number of factors, including its central location, its history as a commercial center and its well-developed financial system. London was home to many of the world's largest financial companies, including BlackRock, Vanguard and Nimb.
  
  2. **The financial impact of the Google Data Center L5/6/7 failure in London on July 22, 2022 was significant.** The failure caused a service outage for some Google products and services, including Gmail, YouTube and Google Search. This resulted in lost revenue for Google and also damaged its reputation as a reliable service provider.

  3. **The impact of the Google L5/6/7 Data Center failure in London was also felt by other financial firms such as BlackRock, Vanguard and Nimb.** These firms also have a significant presence in London and were affected by the interruption of service.
 
  4. **Companies operating in London or receiving investments from BlackRock, Vanguard, Nimb and BNDES have an interest in resolving the Google L5/6/7 Data Center failure problem.**

These companies have lost revenue or reputation which could be worse if another failure occurs.

  5. **There are a few ways to monetize this problem.** One way is to develop and sell solutions to make datacenters more heat resistant. Another way is to develop and sell solutions to help companies recover from data center failures.
 
  6. **Vincent Cerf is one of the founders of the Internet.** He is credited with developing the TCP/IP protocol, which is the foundation of the Internet. The TCP/IP protocol is designed to be resistant to nuclear attacks, whereas it didn't withstand 40 degrees in London.

**Lack of investments?**
 
  7. **OSI layer graph is shown below.** The physical layer is responsible for transporting the data across the network. The data link layer is responsible for ensuring that data is delivered correctly. The network layer is responsible for routing data between different networks. The transport layer is responsible for ensuring that data is delivered in the correct order. The session layer is responsible for establishing and maintaining a connection between two processes. The presentation layer is responsible for converting the data into a format that can be understood by the user. The application layer is responsible for providing services to the user, such as Internet access, e-mail, and chat.

  8. **A historical graph of temperature in London since 1945 is shown below.** The average temperature in London has been gradually increasing in recent years. The highest temperature recorded in London was 38.5 degrees Celsius in 2019.

  9. **The charttreemap temperature in London in 2022 and 2023 is shown below.** The graph shows that the temperature in London was highest in 2022, 42.9oC what in 2023.

  10. **Google bought DeepMind to reduce the cost of energy.** DeepMind is an artificial intelligence company that develops machine learning algorithms. These algorithms can be used to optimize energy usage in data centers.
 
  11. **Ashrae approved a new data center temperature limit of 27 degrees Celsius.** This new limit is higher than the previous limit of 25 degrees Celsius. The temperature threshold increase was approved to help reduce the energy cost of data centers without regard for security.

  12. **In 2020, IBM stopped the Brazilian Internet through a third-party operation, Ascenty, on the São Paulo campus inSTAR 01, STAR 02 and SAO 03.** The failure was caused by a problem with the redundant cooling system with IBM services. The flaw affected Internet access for millions of people in Brazil.

  13. **Power and cooling are not part of the OSI layer.** This is because the OSI layer is responsible for transporting the data across the network. Power and cooling are required to operate a data center, but they are not involved in transporting data.

  14. **The datacenters should be data cloud, but they are still managed like the old CPD, that is, they do not provide external redundancy as standard.**

**Assigning APP outage to utility services such as power and cooling 'attests that the service provider is not configured for redundant APPs external to the DC or Campus'**

**Global**

More than 50% of the planet's electrical energy is produced by transforming fossil fuels, predominantly coal and natural gas, and in this process, more than 50% of the heat produced is not used in the form of energy, being discharged, wasted and dumped on the planet. , also known as Instantaneous Global Warming.
The same happens with more than 500 nuclear sites, with energy efficiency of less than 40%, that is, 60% of the heat produced is thrown into the sea.
Energy waste amounts to US$17 trillion a year, so a company that produces energy, distributes energy, at a minimum, must be ISO 5001 certified to take advantage of this opportunity.

The NetZero transition involves increasing the energy efficiency of the current matrix, including solar, 5 hours a day of production and 20% energy efficiency.

In this scenario we discuss and deliver two solutions:
- Incremental: Natural Gas/H2 Hybrid Networks
- Disruptive: 100% Solar Energy produced by Energy Sites in inhospitable regions such as deserts, globally interconnected by data energy cable, overcoming time zone limitations of up to 12 hours with the surplus supplying dark areas.

**Google Cloud**

 Google's energy demand has grown from around **100 megawatts (MW) in 2000 to around 10 gigawatts (GW) in 2022**. This represents an increase of about 100 times in 22 years.

Google's energy consumption will continue to grow over the next 22 years as the company continues to expand its business and offer new services.

# Google Cloud projects that its energy consumption will increase to 100 GW by 2025 and to 1 terawatt (TW) by 2030. That's about a 10-fold increase by 2022.

**In 2011 the planet consumed 17 TW, while the Sun delivers 86,000 TW.**

# Deep Sun

**Vision**

The Deep Sun Project is an initiative to build a Deep Energy renewable energy ecosystem with the goal of providing clean and affordable energy to the world. The project will be financed through the sale of carbon credit NFTs, which will be backed by PLIMM, a crypto asset already generated at Open Sea.
Yes, distributed Deep Clouds continuously receive power because of different time zones. This means that they can generate power even when the sun is not shining in a certain location.

The total energy was calculated considering the net solar hours. This means that the solar hours that are not used by the Deep Cloud were not accounted for.

For example, if a Deep Cloud is located in a location that receives 6 hours of sunlight per day, but is only operating for 4 hours per day, then only 4 hours of sunlight will count towards the total energy.

By considering net solar hours, we can get a more accurate estimate of how much energy distributed Deep Clouds can generate. This is important because it allows us to assess the potential of the Deep Sun project to provide clean, renewable energy for the Deep City across the deserts of today's world.

**Mission**

The Deep Sun Project has a mission to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and help mitigate climate change. The project also has a mission to provide clean, affordable energy to people around the world.

**Solution**

The Deep Sun Project will build a network of renewable energy Deep Clouds located across the world. The Deep Clouds will be powered by solar, wind and geothermal energy. The energy produced by the Deep Clouds will be sold to businesses and consumers, and the proceeds will be used to finance the project.

**Impact**

The Deep Sun Project has the potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by billions of tons per year. The project also has the potential to provide clean, affordable energy to people around the world.

In phase I, the total energy production of the solar plants is 11.3 terawatts. This is the sum of the energy output of all 16 solar plants listed in the table.

The solar plant with the highest energy production is R&D H1, in Sahara, Libya. This plant has a capacity of 1.02 terawatts. The solar plant with the lowest energy production is R&D CH16, in Canudos, Brazil. This plant has a capacity of 0.28 terawatts.

The total energy output from solar plants is enough to power around 1.2 billion homes. It is also enough to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by around 1.5 billion tons per year.

Solar plants are a clean, renewable source of energy that can help reduce our dependence on fossil fuels. They can also help improve air quality and create jobs.

**Team**

The Deep Sun Project team is comprised of engineers, scientists and energy experts with extensive industry experience. The team has a strong commitment to sustainability and is determined to make a difference in the world.

**Flat**

The Deep Sun Project is currently in the development phase. The team is working to identify locations for the Deep Clouds and to develop the engineering design. The team is also working to develop a commercialization plan for the energy produced by the Deep Clouds.

**Financing**

The Deep Sun Project will be financed through the sale of carbon credit NFTs. The NFTs will be backed by PLIMM, a crypto asset already generated at Open Sea. PLIMM is a sustainable crypto asset that is backed by a network of renewable energy Deep Clouds.

** Issue **

The Deep Sun Project reduces greenhouse gas emissions by billions of tons per year. This is done by building a network of Deep Energy & Deep Clouds of renewable energy and selling clean, affordable energy to businesses and consumers.

# Dear Sundar Pichai

I am writing to you in my capacity as the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom to express my deep concern about the recent disruption of Google Cloud in London on July 19, 2022, when the country experienced a record-breaking temperature of 40.9°C for the first time in history, impacting Google's services. As we know, the TCP/IP protocol was designed by Vincent Cerf to be nuclear attack-resistant, and similarly, Google Cloud relies on services such as:

* GCP offers a variety of networking services, including Cloud Load Balancing, Cloud VPN, and Cloud DNS, which can be used to set up redundancy for applications.
* GCP offers a variety of storage services, including Cloud Storage, Cloud SQL, and Cloud Spanner, which can be used to set up redundancy for data.
* GCP offers a variety of computing services, including Cloud Compute Engine, Cloud Functions, and Cloud App Engine, which can be used to set up redundancy for applications.
* The algorithm used by Google to assess redundancy risk is called the Risk Assessment Tool (RAT). RAT is software that analyzes various factors, including data location, data volume, data type, and data sensitivity. RAT also evaluates the use and quality of redundancy.

As you are aware, the disruption had a significant impact on several clients, including banks and finance, healthcare, government, energy, transportation, retail, manufacturing, telecommunications, media, entertainment, and professional services. The interruption led to delays, revenue losses, data breaches, and even risks to human lives, not to mention the potential risk of the city losing its status as the world's financial capital.

I am particularly concerned about Google's lack of transparency regarding the disruption. Google has been slow to provide information about the cause of the disruption and its effects on customers. I am also worried about the lack of communication from Google with the affected customers. Many clients reported having difficulty reaching Google for information and support regarding the disruption.

I request that Google, through your person, provide the following information to the Parliament:

1. The apparent cause of the disruption, including details about external redundancy and the absence of air conditioning or power, which should be part of the OSI layer.
2. Configuration logs of external redundancy on July 19, 2022, and 2023.
3. The effects of the disruption on customers.
4. The measures that Google is taking to prevent future disruptions.
5. The communication that Google had with the affected customers.

I am confident that Google can provide this information. Google is a leading technology company and has a reputation for reliability. I believe that Google is committed to providing its customers with the best possible services.

Regarding the decision by big tech companies, in line with Ashrae, to raise the data cloud temperature from 25 to 27°C, resulting in a 10% reduction in processing capacity while increasing core temperatures by 3 degrees, requiring additional processing capacity to compensate for the performance loss and subsequently increasing energy consumption, I urge the consideration of new standards. This decision appears to be analogous to the ISO standard for turbines, where the nominal capacity is defined at 15°C and 60% relative humidity, and operating at higher temperatures reduces the nominal capacity. It seems that these factors culminated in the unfortunate event on July 19 in London, when the Data Cloud systems failed due to infrastructural, power, and cooling issues, indicating the lack of external redundancy.

I also request that Google consider renaming its data center in London from "Data Center" to "Deep Cloud." This new name would be more accurate in describing the type of facility that Google is establishing in London and around the world: distributed data clouds with standard external redundancy.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

Sincerely,

Rishi Sunak
Prime Minister of the United Kingdom

Sincerely,

Pichai
